This project is an exploration of different web technologies. Unlike a conventional readme, this file contains
notes made along this journey.

## Initial setup

The repo was initialized inside of github and then cloned to my local machine. I added React using **create-react-app**
and used the **typescript** flag as well. Then proceeded to add **Grommet** as the UI dependecy of choice.

```cli
npx create-react-app . --template typescript
npm install grommet grommet-icons styled-components --save
```

To familiarize myself with using Grommet i followed the [tutorial](https://github.com/grommet/grommet-starter-new-app) found on their github.

For ease of formatting, prettier was introduced in the IDE and a `.prettierrc.json` file was created.
